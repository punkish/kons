    <p>Humans seek natural environment for its beauty, comfort, and at times, for its quietness. In reality, nature is hardly quiet. In fact, it is noisy, full of sounds ranging from soft murmurs to a cacophony. In this medley of sounds, insects, birds and animals, not just thousands, but thousands of kinds of thousands, manage to communicate. Imagine walking in a room full of thousands of people talking in hundreds of different languages to others who speak the same. It would be incomprehensible. But, in nature, a complex system of communication allows maximization of signal over noise in, what the bioacoustics scientist Rohini Balakrishnan calls <i>an ecology of communication.</i><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
    
    <p>But, it is not just an individual specimen of a specific species communicating with its own kind, perhaps to communicate food, or to find mates. There are also predators listening in on potential preys, and potential preys trying to warn others of their own kind of the presence of danger. Sound patterns can uncover all of this and more. They can give an indication of the boundaries of habitat and of the level of diversity in a population.</p>
    
    <p>Now, to that magnificient chamber of sounds, add humans – talking, singing, shouting, using tools, building things, driving cars, revving motorboats, sounding horns of trucks, ships blowing their horns. Sounds bounce off trees, on leaves, get absorbed by moss, reflected by rock, travel differently through water, diminished or magnified.</p>
    
    <p>Ecoacoustics investigates and interprets the ecological role of sound, drawing from the related arts-humanities discipline of acoustic ecology which studies sonically-mediated relationships between human beings, non-human organisms, and their environments.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Ecoacoustics research provides new insights on the marine biological soundscape and on the potential use of this field in ecological monitoring programs.<sup><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup id="fnref:3"></p>
    
    <p>Studies suggest that plants sense natural airborne sounds and respond to them rapidly, and may be affected by other sounds as well, including anthropogenic ones.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> And perhaps, if only we learn how to listen better, we might find that stressed plants emit airborne sounds that can be recorded remotely, both in acoustic chambers and in greenhouses.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
    
    <p>We have been experimenting with ecoacoustics, hardware and sensors, setting us up perfectly for this next phase of our explorations in the sonic environment around us.</p>
    
    <p>We will expand into the broader area of bioacoustics which includes all forms of acoustic animal communication and related behaviour; sound production, hearing; impacts of noise; environmental monitoring; recording and analysis equipment and techniques; etc.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
    
    <p>The processes of both art an science involve conversion of one form of signal into another. Whether an artist is using colors or sounds or sensations to express ideas and emotions or an scientist is converting sensed signals – light, movement, temperature, radiation, etc. – into data, charts, visualization, conceptually the process is an interlinked steps of algorithms converting ouput from the previous step into input for the subsequent step. We intend to use sound as the input and convert it into other forms of energy (all signals are energy) as part of our art installation.</p>

    <p>But we don’t intend to stop with a more traditional setup wherein an immutable<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> work of art is observed by a passive viewer. After all, that is not how the natural environment works where our presence and every action has an effect. Using ambient sensors and wearables, we will create a feedback loop whereby the very act of watching and experiencing will affect the environment, and hence, the art installation. In this way, we will convey the place of humans in a much larger system, intricately interconnected and interdependent. Every action has a consequence, and change is the only constant. That is the truth.</p>

    <p>Kika has been studying marine noise pollution and its effect on marine life, and using her observations and findings to construct art installations that put the viewer in the situation that an animal in water experiences. This requires recording marine sounds, both natural and human made, in a diverse environments and locales, processing them through software and using them to control light and movement, all working together to create an immersive experience. Meanwhile, Puneet has been working with open hardware and sensors, collaborating with artists on projects that involve sensing of environmental parameters, visualization of data, 3D printing and other related technologies. Working together, we intend to take our experiments into a higher level of complexity and investigation, looking for understanding of not just how humans impact the environment but also seeking inspiration in how the non-human world communicates. <i>If we listen, perhaps we can hear what it is trying to tell us.</i></p>
